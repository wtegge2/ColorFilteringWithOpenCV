## Intro

Welcome to my Color Filtering Project! My name is Will, and I am very excited you are here! In this project, I dived into the world of computer vision and the OpenCV library. I learned what computer vision is and how it is used in our world today. I also learned how to write my own computer vision code using the OpenCV library. In this repo, you will find two files. One of them (OpenCVTesting.ipynb) contains code copied from an online tutorial linked in the [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements) section below, and the other one (ColorFiltering.ipynb) contains code that I wrote on my own. 


## Background

The motivation behind this project comes from a combination of my passion for learning, a Robotics course at DTU, and my interest and excitement about AI and machine learning. In my robotics course, my final assignment involves programming a robot arm to perform a certain task using its camera (follow a line, type a word by pressing keys on a keyboard, point out skittles of a certain color, etc) The skittles task sounded the most challenging and interesting to me. I started researching into computer vision and how to write code to accomplish this task, and then I found the OpenCV library. I read through the tutorial site online thuroughly. With the help of that website, random googling and stackoverflow visits, I was able to write my own code  

I have never worked with computer vision before


## Code Explanation

Code explanation and comments can be found above every function and to the right of almost every line. I tried to comment and explaina everything as best as I could, but if you cannot understand anything, please reach out. 


## Future Steps and Ideas

* Image Blurring (faces, inapropriate images, etc)
* Facial Recognition
